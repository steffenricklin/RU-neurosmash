## Assignment 

- Create an artificial agent that learns to control an environment
- You can use any algorithm (e.g. q-learning, evo, policy gradient)
- Add one idea which improves biological plausibility 

#### Assignment Components
- Online demonstration
- Source code
- Written report (4-page report in [NeurIPS workshop paper format](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2020/mnshsmqkjsqz))

evaluation metrics: performance, creativity, elegance, rigor, plausibility

## TODO's

### Phase 1. Implement world models and replicate world model findings ðŸ§©

> Internal deadline: November 20, 2020

We will do something with the world models.

[[github](https://worldmodels.github.io/)] [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10122.pdf)]

This has 3 main components

- Autoencoder (Ron, Steffen)
- RNN & Controller (Daphne, Stijn, David)

We ideally would like to have 
- Paper read 
- Get a working baseline, all of the above components


### Phase 2. Add biological plausibility ðŸ§ 

> Internal deadline: November 26, 2020

- Can be at the level of learning, network architecture, neuron model, exploration strategy etc.
- Use the lectures, podcasts, papers for inspiration to come up with a good addition 
- Make sure it is actually plausible (i.e. based on how the brain works)

### Phase 3. Wrapping up and write report ðŸ“‹

> Internal deadline: December 2, 2020

- Fix bugs, make sure everything works smoothly (rigor)
- Make sure code & documentation is on point (elegance)
- Write report 

### Other details

- We collaborate through github
- Meet: **Thursdays** 8.30 - 10.30 , **Fridays** 15:30-18:00
- Divide and conquer, work in teams of 2??
